* Alpha Vision

** Learning Techniques
*** Ralph Vince - Mathematics for Market
    DEADLINE: <2016-09-28 qua>
    Provide a schedule and a resume on the subject.

*** Quantitative Trading and Money Management

** Trends
   Calculate trends: BB; HMA; ATR; Stochastic; MACD

*** TODO Debug signals
    eurusd 4h: 18-19/08 hma12 cross down
    eurusd 4h: 23-25/08 hma13 cross down
    usdjpy 1h: 7/09     macd cross up

*** TODO flush file handler

*** TODO provide a trend input structure / for each trend type

** Positions/Trader
   Deal with positions and execute entry/exit points.


*** TODO do *not* open new position near current placed position
    sometimes multiple signals are sent on same bet, creating
    multiple positions with almost the same entry/exit price.

 
*** TODO Organize trader algorithms

*** Improve Trader Algorithms
    DEADLINE: <2016-09-03 sáb>
    Trend Types:
    - trending <- move neutral / bull / bear
      HMA / BB channel / MACD
    - move strength <- play validation
      Stochastic / BB above/bellow std2
    - pivot levels <- play positions lines
      Pivot / Fibonacci / MAs / BB top/middle/bottom lines
    - volatility <- play type scalp / breakout
      ATR / Chaikin
    - signals <- whether it shall put an order
      HMA periods cross / MACD main & signal cross / Stochastic main & signal cross

    Algorithm Types:
    - Trend inclined (use major/current/fast trends)
    - TradingRange Helper! (signals with support&resistance levels)
    - Scalper (low volatility under fast timeframes)
    - Swinger (higher volatility & using pivot levels on slower timeframes)
    - Orchestra: macd for signals, stochastic for confirmation (overbought/oversold)
      and BB for entry/exit points.

*** Trader timeframes

**** TODO pass positions to different timeframes handlers?

**** TODO Update existing positions

*** Risk & Reward Optimization

** Signals Comparison
   Calculate and use Trends to capture signals.
   - SpreadSheet results formula:
     =sum(FILTER(H2:H224, I2:I224 <> "cancelled", D2:D224 > "2000.01.01 00:00:00"))
     =sum(filter(N2:N1113, regexmatch(O2:O1113, "[5]")))

*** TODO Algorithmic exits on bad entries
     on Overbought/Oversold entries going against it, can workout
     some good exits

*** TODO Check/compare different algorithm trade signals
    Those implemented on Trader Algorithms

** MQL

*** TODO python script to update results to google spreadsheets
    DEADLINE: <2016-09-11 Dom>

*** TODO use external DLLs - try with R package
    DEADLINE: <2016-09-24 Sáb>

*** Flux Signals
