*** Ralph Vince - Mathematics for Market
    DEADLINE: <2016-09-28 qua>
    Provide a resume on the subject.

    DEADLINE: <2016-08-26 sex>
    - ok ATR
    - ok Stochastic
    - ok MACD
    - RSI?

*** TODO provide a trend input structure / for each trend type

** Positions/Trader
   Deal with positions and execute entry/exit points.

*** TODO Trader Algorithms
    DEADLINE: <2016-08-27 sáb>
    - Trend inclined (use major/current/fast trends)
    - TradingRange Helper! (signals with support&resistance levels)
    - Scalper (using only fast trends)
    - Swinger (using support&resistence levels / higher targets and stopLosses)
    - Orchestra: macd for signals, stochastic for confirmation (overbought/oversold)
      and BB for entry/exit points.

*** TODO Update existing positions

*** TODO Orders Pool?

*** Risk & Reward Optimization

** Signals Comparison
   Calculate and use Trends to capture signals.
   - SpreadSheet results formula:
     =sum(FILTER(H2:H224, I2:I224 <> "cancelled", D2:D224 > "2000.01.01 00:00:00"))

*** TODO Elaborate rule of symbols to use on different trade signals
    DEADLINE: <2016-08-28 dom>

*** TODO Check/compare different algorithm trade signals
    Those implemented on Trader Algorithms

** MQL

*** use external DLLs
*** Flux Signals
